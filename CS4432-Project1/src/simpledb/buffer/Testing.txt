We initially attempted JUnit testing, but this proved nearly impossible due to the nature of simpleDB. As such, the majority of our
testing was done by running the SQL commands outlined in Examples.sql. As the buffer manager is an integral part of the system, any mistake
would (and did) lead to errors. 

The vast majority of our testing was performed by adding print statements at various points in the program. SQL commands were then run in the same order 
as in Examples.sql.

CLOCK POLICY:
The new toString() method prints out the current clock position. If the clock position is updated correctly and the SQL commands return the proper values,
the clock replacement policy is clearly functional.
